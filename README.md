# 🎮 Twitch Streaming Data Insights

This is a personal project where I scraped top streamer data from [TwitchTracker](https://twitchtracker.com) and analyzed it using Python. The goal was to explore patterns in viewership, streaming hours, and efficiency across Twitch's top-performing channels.

## 📊 What I Did

- Scraped Twitch data using Puppeteer (Node.js + Stealth & Adblocker plugins)
- Saved scraped results as `.csv` files
- Analyzed and visualized data in Python using:
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
- Created bar charts and scatter plots to identify streaming trends
- Summarized insights into streamer behavior and audience engagement

## 📁 Project Files

- `Twitch_Streaming_Insights.ipynb` – The full Google Colab notebook with code, charts, and commentary
- `english-*.csv` – A sample of the scraped Twitch data (top English channels)

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Channels with high viewership don't always stream the most
- Some streamers have high engagement with fewer hours streamed
- Viewer count efficiency can help identify breakout creators
